    <h1>CSC209 Software Tools and Systems Programming</h1>
    <p>
      Software techniques in a Unix-style environment, using scripting languages
      and a machine-oriented programming language (typically C). What goes on in
      the operating system when programs are executed. Core topics: creating and
      using software tools, pipes and filters, file processing, shell
      programming, processes, system calls, signals, basic network programming.

              represents the height of the board (the number of rows),<br />
              the second represents the width of the board (the number of
              columns), and the third represents the number of states to print.

              C program that constructs a tree (an FTree) representing a file
              tree rooted at the file specified by the user. You will also write
              a function to walk an FTree and to print some of the file
              information stored in it.<br />
              For example, here is the output of our solution run on the example
              directory from the previous section (see below for information on
              the order that items appear):

              The goal of this assignment is to practice creating and using
              multiple processes in C. For this assignment, you will write a
              multi-process implementation of the
              <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem"
                >Closest Pair of Points</a
              ><br />that takes advantage of parallel computation. In other
              words, using pipes() to communicate between processes.

              For this assignment, we created a simple version of a Twitter
              server. When a new user connects, the server will send them
              "Welcome to CSC209 Twitter! Enter your username: ".<br />
              After they input an acceptable name that is not equal to any
              existing users's username and is not the empty string, they are
              added to Twitter, and all active users (if any) are alerted to the
              addition (e.g., "Karen has just joined."). <br />If they input an
              unacceptable name, they should be notified and asked again to.
              enter their name.<br />
              Furthermore they can:<br />

    <h1>Reflection &#9997</h1>
    <p>Overall:3.5/5, Workload 3.5/5, Difficulity 4/5</p>
    <p>
      The workload was fair. Content wise, one of the most interesting courses
      I've taken. Learning about parallel processing opened my eyes about how
      CPU's work with video games. <br />Exploring C and its "low levelness"
      showed me how computer work under the hood. I can now see why smart
      thermometers or just smaller devices are made with C.
