    <h1>263 Data Structures & Analysis</h1>
    <p>
      Algorithm analysis: worst-case, average-case, and amortized complexity.
      Expected worst-case complexity, randomized quicksort and selection.
      Standard abstract data types, such as graphs, dictionaries, priority
      queues, and disjoint sets. A variety of data structures for implementing
      these abstract data types, such as balanced search trees, hashing, heaps,
      and disjoint forests. Design and comparison of data structures.
      Introduction to lower bounds.
