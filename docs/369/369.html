    <h1>369 Operating Systems</h1>
    <p>
      Principles of operating systems. The operating system as a control program
      and as a resource allocator. The concept of a process and concurrency
      problems: synchronization, mutual exclusion, deadlock. Additional topics
      include memory management, file systems, process scheduling, threads, and
      protection.

    <p>
      369 focused on memory, syncronization/concurrency and filesysytems. Took the class with Karen Reid. She was very clear about how the internals of a computer worked by providing context and slowly building up solutions. Highly recommend as this is a CS person's CS course.
