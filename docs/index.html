  I am a third year computer science student at the University of TorontoI.
  Outside of school, I am the biggest NBA fanatic you’ll probably meet. Given an
  NBA team I can probably give you a one sentence summary about any given player
  on that team. Inside of school, I’m passionate about machine learning and game
  development.
